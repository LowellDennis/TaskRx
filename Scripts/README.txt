TaskRx Scripts Directory
=======================

This directory contains scripts used by the TaskRx application. These scripts are referenced
in the AllTasks.json configuration file and are executed by the application when tasks are run.

DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY these scripts unless you know what you're doing, as it may cause
the application to malfunction.

If you need to add custom scripts, you can place them in this directory and reference them
in the AllTasks.json file.
